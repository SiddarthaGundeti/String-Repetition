# String-Repetition
**Write a program to print the given input word three times in a single line separated by spaces**
Explanation:
Step 1: Get the user's input
The first thing we need to do is get the user's input. We'll use the input() function to do this. The input() function waits for the user to type something, and then it stores the typed text in a variable. Let's call this variable word. 
Step 2: Create the repeated string
Now that we have the user's input stored in the word variable, we can create a new string with the given word repeated three times, separated by spaces. To do this, we'll first add a space to the end of the word using the + sign. Then, we'll use the * operator to repeat the word with the space three times. We'll store the result in a new variable called message.
Step 3: Print the repeated string
